This is a repository for a script made to scrap the booking website Kayak using pythonâ€™s library Selenium and gather the information in a markdown format to be sent automatically  via email.

To run the code you just need to run main.py (Don't forget to add your own information in the Personal information section variables at the top of the script)

Make sure to install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
